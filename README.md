# VCCS
VCCS is a collection of ComputerCraft utilities that I originally wrote to be able to download programs from a GitHub repository.

## Installation
Use `pastebin get W632YDDS8 vccs` to download the VCCS installer. Then run `vccs install [commands]` to install the tools you want or `vccs install all` to install all VCCS commands.

Just enter `vccs update` to update all your installed vccs programs.

## Downloading a file from the internet
You can use the *dl* tool to download a file from a website by specifying its url.

## Setting the path for a command
The *sp* command can be used to add a program to the path. That way you can just access the command by its filename without having to specify a path.
