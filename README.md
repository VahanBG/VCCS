# VCCS
VCCS is a collection of ComputerCraft utilities that I originally wrote to be able to download programs from a GitHub repository.

## Usage
You can just execute a script on your CC computer to see how it works.

## Downloading a file from the internet
You can use the *dl* tool to download a file from a website by specifying its url.
